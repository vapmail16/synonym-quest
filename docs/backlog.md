## 📐 **11+ Maths — Planned (after practice MVP)**

*Deferred on purpose: ship content + browsing first.*

- [ ] **Timed exams / practice papers** — fixed-length sessions, clock, submit all
- [ ] **Games mode** — speed rounds, streak scoring, maths badges tied to progress
- [ ] **Progress persistence** — per-user attempts, weak topics, spaced repetition
- [ ] **Optional** — composite DB unique index on `(math_topic_id, external_id)` if duplicate seeds become an issue (removed from Sequelize model for pg-mem test compatibility)
