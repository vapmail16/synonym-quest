## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests (Jest + React Testing Library)
- Component rendering and behavior
- Utility functions and hooks
- API service functions
- Business logic functions

### 2. Integration Tests (Cypress)
- End-to-end user workflows
- API integration testing
- Database operations
- LLM integration testing

### 3. Test Coverage Goals
- Frontend: 90%+ coverage
- Backend: 95%+ coverage
- Critical paths: 100% coverage

## 🤖 LLM Integration Strategy

### OpenAI API Usage
- **Synonym Suggestions**: Generate synonyms for user input
- **Answer Validation**: Fuzzy matching for user answers
- **Difficulty Assessment**: Classify words by difficulty level
- **Hint Generation**: Provide contextual hints

### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/ai/suggest-synonyms
POST /api/ai/validate-answer
POST /api/ai/assess-difficulty
POST /api/ai/generate-hint
```

## 📱 Progressive Web App Features

## 🚀 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize frontend and backend projects
   - Configure TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier
   - Set up testing frameworks
   - Create Docker development environment

2. **Backend Core**
   - Database schema design
   - Basic CRUD operations for words
   - Authentication middleware
   - API documentation (Swagger)

3. **Frontend Core**
   - Component library setup
   - Routing configuration
   - State management setup
   - Basic UI components

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 2)
1. **Word Management**
   - Add/edit/delete words interface
   - Search and filtering
   - Data validation and error handling
   - Unit tests for all components

2. **Quiz Engine**
   - Quiz logic implementation
   - Answer validation system
   - Scoring and feedback
   - Session management

3. **LLM Integration**
   - OpenAI API integration
   - Synonym suggestion service
   - Answer validation with AI
   - Error handling and fallbacks

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Week 3)
1. **PWA Features**
